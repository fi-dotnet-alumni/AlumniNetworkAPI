## General Information

Alumni Network API is an ASP.NET Core Web API that provides endpoints for [Alumni Network](https://github.com/Tooppa/alumni-network) frontend client.

The Alumni Network web app is a group project made during the Experis Academy Full-Stack Developer course hosted by Noroff. Project members are listed in the [Contributors](#contributors) section. This repository essentially contains the backend portion of the app.

The fictional use case for the project was that both Experis and Noroff had experienced difficulty in maintaining contact with past candidates to notify them of social events and gathering data for quality assurance purposes. Our primary task was to create an Alumni Network Portal to facilitate this kind of communication.

In the application itself users can register, log in, browse and post messages in various groups and topics, create new topics and groups, subscribe to existing topics or join groups, comment posts, edit their profile information and send private messages to other users.
